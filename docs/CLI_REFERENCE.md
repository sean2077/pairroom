# CLI reference

CLI Reference describes command responsibilities and how to discover flags. It does not copy the full `--help` output of every subcommand. Exact defaults, allowed values, and platform differences always come from the current binary.

New standalone Rooms support `pairroom serve --collaboration default` (the default) or `--collaboration custom --collaboration-instructions "..."`. An existing Room restores its saved instructions; conflicting explicit flags fail. `pairroom protocol` prints the shared v6 mechanics; the removed `--role` flag no longer selects a collaboration mode.

## Top-level commands

| Command | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `pairroom daemon` | Install and manage pairroom service in the OS service manager |
| `pairroom service` | Start the multi-Project / multi-Room Management Shell |
| `pairroom serve` | Start the single-repository compatibility entry (legacy single-Room) |
| `pairroom doctor` | Validate Git and vendor CLI installation |
| `pairroom providers` | Read and validate the sanitized CC Switch Profile catalog without changing current state |
| `pairroom verify` | Strictly validate room data integrity |
| `pairroom backup` | Create a verified room-data backup |
| `pairroom restore` | Restore and verify a room-data backup |
| `pairroom diagnostics` | Generate a redacted diagnostics bundle |
| `pairroom protocol` | Print the versioned Agent collaboration contract |
| `pairroom version` | Print the build version |

Start every command with:

```bash
pairroom --help
pairroom <command> --help
```

## Common entry points

From a source checkout, stop leftover daemon ownership and open the current Management Shell:

```bash
make dev
```

That is `go run ./cmd/pairroom service --recover-stale-lock` after `make stop`. Mock Management Service with an installed binary:

```bash
pairroom service --mock
```

Do not open a browser automatically:

```bash
pairroom service --no-browser
```

Print a machine-readable Agent protocol:

```bash
pairroom protocol --json
```

Show version:

```bash
pairroom version
```

Project and Room lifecycle is managed by the `pairroom service` Management Shell and REST API, not by this CLI. Daemon, Backup, Restore, and similar commands have subcommands or dedicated flags. Do not guess flags from older docs; read `--help` at the matching command level.

Backup and Restore target one Room, not a multi-Room Service root. Backup and diagnostics output paths must be outside the source Room data directory. See [Operations](OPERATIONS.md#backup) for complete-Service rollback scope.

## Exit and errors

- Argument, configuration, and security-precondition errors return a non-zero exit code;
- CLI acceptance of a request does not mean a native Turn completed successfully;
- A destructive command should first show the target and preconditions; scripts must check the exit code and output;
- Removed routing and hop-limit flags are rejected; use the current command's `--help` instead of old automation examples.

## Source flag inventory

The following names are extracted from `cmd/pairroom/*.go`. Use them to find omissions; they do not mean every flag applies to every command.

## Installation versus runtime availability

`pairroom doctor` is a Git / CLI protocol-metadata check, not an authentication or inference test. It checks the two configured slots, including Grok Build when selected; executable overrides are `--claude-command`, `--codex-command`, and `--grok-command` and follow the Runtime kind rather than the historical slot name.

```bash
pairroom doctor --config /absolute/path/pairroom.json --repo /absolute/path/project --json
# Explicit consent: this can consume Provider quota and create native sessions.
pairroom doctor --config /absolute/path/pairroom.json --live --json
```

`--live` uses each config-file Agent's Runtime, Provider, model, and effort. It starts a fresh native session in a disposable Git workspace, narrows native permissions, requests only a nonce response, and requires both the expected text and its matching input-completed event. It stops on a tool/approval request and attempts native shutdown and temporary-directory cleanup on every exit. Native global configuration, hooks, and MCP still apply: this is not an isolation sandbox or a tool-compatibility certification. Each Agent check has a 75-second budget plus bounded shutdown; Ctrl+C cancels it. The JSON adds separate `checks` for startup/response, and failures make the command exit nonzero. Existing `doctor` JSON still includes local paths; review it before sharing.

The Management **Settings → Diagnostics** section offers the same live check with explicit confirmation and cancellation, plus Service storage, Registry, Project, capacity, and three-CLI environment checks. Its default pair follows the saved Service default Agent pair profile; selecting a Room uses that Room's immutable selections. CLI `doctor` instead uses the supplied configuration file, not Service-scoped profiles. Neither entry point resumes an existing Room session. Mock results are explicitly unverified.

**Download safe report** exports only check codes/statuses, platform, numeric versions, timestamps, and timings. It excludes local paths, Room names/IDs, Provider details, native session IDs, command arguments, credentials, and raw process/model output. This report does not replace `pairroom diagnostics`, the existing redacted Room archive bundle.
